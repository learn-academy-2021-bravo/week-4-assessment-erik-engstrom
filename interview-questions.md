# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable in Ruby is a variable that is instantiated for a new class or Hash in Ruby. This instance variable passes through the attributes of that particular variable class and inherits the components of that class.

  Researched answer: An instance variable starts with the @ symbol and only belongs to one specific class while class variables are shared between classes and subclasses.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block in Ruby is the part of executable code similar to the code block {} in javascript. Ruby has blocks that are declared by a 'do' key word and execuatable code following.  

  Researched answer: A ruby block is a way of grouping statements. The block is written starting on the same line and the method call's last parameter. braces {} are used for single line blocks and do...end for multi-line blocks.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return is one that is implied and a return does not need to be declared.

  Researched answer: When a return isn't explicitly returned, Ruby returns the value of the last executed instruction in the method and that is an implicit return. 



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object oriented programming is programming that treats everything as an object and all the properties of an object can be called upon to manipulate and extract the key or value of said object. OOP differs from functional programming in a way that fuctional programming focuses on utilizing functions to execute code, OOP utilizes methods more than functions. 

  Researched answer: OOP is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints, which are used to create individual instances of objects.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint for objects and an object has a key and a value associated with it.

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint for objects and an object is a member or an instance of a class.
